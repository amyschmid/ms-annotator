=head1 svr_function_of

Get functions of protein-encoding genes

------

Example:

    svr_all_features 3702.1 peg | svr_function_of

would produce a 2-column table.  The first column would contain
PEG IDs for genes occurring in genome 3702.1, and the second
would contain the functions of those genes.

------

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line 
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the PEG for which functions are being requested.
If some other column contains the PEGs, use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the PEG in each case.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing PEGs is not the last.

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added (the function associated with the PEG).
